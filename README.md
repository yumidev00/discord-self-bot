# discord selfbot

This is a basic implementation of the API. You can do a lot more with it! For now, it's just a proof of concept.

You can use it as a personal assistant, chatbot, or whatever you want. Needless to say, it goes against Discord TOS, so use it at your own risk

# How to use

move `dotenv` to `.env` and fill it with your token

install missing dependencies if needed

run `python main.py`
